> **TL;DR**: No campus offer? You’ve still got four real doors: **B.T.C. + Govt teacher (stable)**, **pre-employment tests + upskilling (predictable)**, **Bangalore walk-ins (high variance, high reward)**, and **YouTube + personal brand (long game)**. Pick based on your risk, runway, and *why*. Below is how I evaluated each, the mistakes I made, and the steps I’d repeat.

## Cold Open: Placement Week, Zero Offers, Maximum Drama

Picture this: I’m in my hostel room, resume glowing brighter than my future, and yet… *No Offer.*  
Phones buzzing with “congrats” messages—from other people’s lives. My dad calls from **Mahroni**: “Beta, do **B.T.C.** (Basic Training Certificate), become a **primary school teacher**. Safe, respected, trending here.”  
My heart says **Bangalore**. My bank account says **be serious**. My inner Deadpool says **plot twist**.

So I wrote my own script. If you’re here, maybe you’re writing yours too.

## The Four Doors (and the Monster Behind Each)

### 1) Stay in Mahroni → Do **B.T.C.** → Govt Teacher (Primary)
- **Why it’s great**: Clear path, social respect, monthly salary, community impact, low chaos.
- **The monster**: Competitive merit, forms/paperwork, slower skill compounding outside tech.
- **Best for you if**: You want **stability**, hometown roots, and long-term security.
- **Starter Pack**:
  - Prep your docs, track notifications, apply early.
  - Teach + **side-projects**: after school hours, build a **YouTube channel** or teach coding to local kids. Passive content + steady job = underrated combo.

### 2) **Bhopal/nearby city** → Train + **Pre-Employment Tests** (eLitmus, CoCubes, AMCAT)
- **Why it’s great**: Warmup zone before the boss fight. You’ll sharpen **DSA + Apti + Communication** and get test-based interviews.
- **The monster**: Test fees, time pressure, paralysis by prep.
- **Best for you if**: You want a **structured path**, some predictability, and time to level up.
- **Starter Pack (8 weeks)**:
  - **Weeks 1–2**: Resume, GitHub readme, 2 clone projects (auth + dashboard).  
  - **Weeks 3–6**: Aptitude (daily), DSA (arrays, strings, hash, sliding window, basic DP), 2 mock interviews/week.  
  - **Week 7**: Take 1 test (e.g., eLitmus).  
  - **Week 8**: Take 2nd test + start cold emailing with a crisp portfolio link.

### 3) **Bangalore** → Walk-ins, Referrals, Interviews, Repeat
- **Why it’s great**: Density of opportunities, **serendipity** factor, real market feedback fast.
- **The monster**: Rent, rejection storms, burnout risk if you come unprepared.
- **Best for you if**: You can handle **variance**, have **3–4 months runway**, and learn well in chaos.
- **Starter Pack (survive & ship)**:
  - Shared room/hostel; cook simple meals; bus/metro > cabs.
  - Daily ritual: **2 walk-ins / 10 targeted emails / 1 referral reach-out**.
  - Every weekend: **Ship one small project** that solves a real problem (mini CRM, CPQ flow mock, resume parser, etc.). Post it with a short Loom demo.

### 4) **YouTube** → Document + Build in Public (with a Day Job or College/Teaching)
- **Why it’s great**: Compounds career, proof of consistency, attracts mentors/recruiters.
- **The monster**: Slow start, algorithm mood swings, ego tests.
- **Best for you if**: You care about **storytelling**, **brand**, and long-term **optionality**.
- **Starter Pack (the *1+1+1* cadence)**:
  - **1 Short** (your learning of the week)  
  - **1 Post** (LinkedIn/Twitter: a distilled insight)  
  - **1 Project** (tiny, shippable, documented)  
  - Repeat for **12 weeks**. This is literally career CPR.

## The Decision Matrix (a.k.a. “Choose Your Own Chaos”)

| Factor | B.T.C./Teacher | Tests Route | Bangalore Walk-ins | YouTube (with any path) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Risk** | Low | Medium | High | Medium (Low if side) |
| **Money now** | Stable | Starts after offer | Uncertain | Slow start |
| **Learning speed** | Medium | High (structured) | Very high (market) | High (communication + tech) |
| **Family alignment** | High | Medium | Varies | High (if side) |
| **Option value** | Medium | High | Very high | Very high (brand) |

**My rule:** pick **one primary** + **one secondary**.  
For me? **Primary: Bangalore**, **Secondary: YouTube**. If I had **zero runway**, I’d do **B.T.C.** as primary + **YouTube** as secondary.

## My Story, Not the Instagram Version

I packed a bag, landed in **Bangalore**, and realized my resume was the most fictional thing I’d ever written. The city didn’t care about “Objective: To work in a dynamic organization.” It cared about **links**.

So I built:
- A tiny **Quote Dashboard** clone in a weekend (data seed + filters).  
- A clean **“island UI”** portfolio with 3 real problems solved.  
- A **2-minute Loom** per project—what, why, how.

I sent **10 crisp emails a day**—subject line: `Built X to fix Y (2-min demo)`.  
I got **rejections**, **ignores**, **“we’ll get back”**. But then, **one** call turned to **three**, and that turned into **my first break**. Not magic. Just compounding, daily.

1. **2 hours**: DSA/Apt (one topic, two problems).  
2. **2 hours**: Project feature (ship, commit, screenshot, Loom).  
3. **90 mins**: Apply + email 10 relevant companies (not spray & pray).  
4. **30 mins**: Post 1 thing you learned (LinkedIn/Twitter).  

**Weekend**  
- **Ship one end-to-end feature** + write a **mini case study** (`/projects/feature-x`).

### Your 30-Day B.T.C. + Brand (if you stay in Mahroni)
- Weekdays: Teaching + **1 hour** of skilling (DSA or a cert).  
- Weekends: **YouTube** (document your prep), a small app for your students (notes portal, attendance, quiz).  
- Build a **local tech club**—your leadership becomes your portfolio.

### Your 8-Week Tests Sprint (if you choose eLitmus/CoCubes/AMCAT)
- **Weeks 1–2**: Setup clean GitHub, 2 real projects, resume v3.  
- **Weeks 3–6**: Apti + DSA blocks (alternate days), 2 mocks/week, 1 interview buddy.

## Scripts That Actually Got Replies

**Subject**: Built a tiny **Quote-Flow** demo for <company> (2-min Loom)  
**Body**:  
Hi \<Name\>, saw \<team/product\>. I built a minimal clone that fixes \<specific pain\>.  
Demo (2 min): \<link\> • Code: \<repo\>  
If it looks useful, happy to walk you through or iterate.  
— \<Your Name\>, \<city\>, \<phone\>

**Referral DM (LinkedIn)**  
“Hey \<Name\>, loved your post on \<topic\>. I built a small tool that improves \<metric\>. If you think \<team\> cares about this, could I send you a 2-min demo? If not, totally fine—appreciate your time!”

## What About Money? (Runway Reality)

- **If ₹0–20k**: Favour **B.T.C. + YouTube** or **Tests from home**.  
- **If ₹50k–1L**: **Bhopal + Tests** or **Bangalore (PG + cook)** with strict budget.  
- **If family pressure high**: Align with **B.T.C.** and keep **YouTube/projects** as your compounding engine.

Remember: your **first salary** is not your **ceiling**—it’s your **runway**.

## FAQ I Wish Someone Answered

**Q: Won’t I “waste” my degree if I become a primary teacher?**  
**A:** No. Your degree is a **tool**, not a prison. You can **teach + build**. Tons of creators started outside their “degree lane.”

**Q: Is Bangalore worth it without contacts?**  
**A:** Yes, **if** you show work every week. The city rewards signal. Build → Show → Iterate.

**Q: Can YouTube pay the bills in 6 months?**  
**A:** Unlikely. Treat it as a **brand moat** first, revenue later (sponsors, consulting, products).

## If I Were You (Choose One Primary + One Secondary)

- **Low risk / High family alignment**: **B.T.C. + YouTube**  
- **Structured and predictable**: **Tests + Portfolio**  
- **High growth / High variance**: **Bangalore + Projects**  
- **Long-term brand**: **Any + YouTube (1 short/week, 1 project/week)**

Pick your two. **Start this week.** Your career is a series of small, audacious Tuesdays.
